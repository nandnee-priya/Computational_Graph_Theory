# Computational Graph Theory
This week we will focus on Tree Algorithms, Binary Trees and Minimum Spanning Tree. You can watch videos 7,8,9,10,11,12 for Tree algorithms and videos 30, 31, 32 for Minimum Spanning Tree from here [William Fiset's Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P) and see the concept and implementation for Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees from step 13 and 14 and Minimum Spanning Tree from Step 15 Lec 5 [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2).
