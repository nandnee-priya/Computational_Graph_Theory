# Computational Graph Theory
This repository contains the resources and problems for _Computational Graph Theory_ project in Seasons of Code. The book followed for theory is _Introduction to Graph Theory_ by _Douglas West_.  
  
The timeline of the project is as follows:  
Week 1: Learning the data structure of graphs  
Week 2: Implementation of BFS, DFS  
Week 3: Dijkstra and A* search algorithm  
Week 4: Minimum spanning tree algorithms  
Week 5: Bipartite Matching problem, Hall's Theorem  
Week 6: Network Flow algorithms, Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm  
Week 7: Graph coloring algorithms and making a sudoku solver based on it  
Week 8: Approximate Algorithms for the Travelling Salesman Problem
